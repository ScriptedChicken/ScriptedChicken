- Hi there! I'm Angus, a geospatial developer based in New Zealand.
- I love learning about new technologies and APIs, especially those to do with automating GIS.
- I'm currently improving my skills in pyQGIS, Arcpy, and the Esri suite. I also love working on projects in my spare time; anything from web mapping to card-game making to exploring the Linux ecosystem. I also do a lot of non-GIS related projects in my spare time.

Interested in seeing more? See these repos to get you started:
- USER Scavenger Hunt map - An example of using JavaScript to create interactive maps and applications. This particular app uses Leaflet as a mapping library.

- Return QGIS Algorithm - A QGIS addon that allows zero-click searching and copying of pyQGIS expressions.

- Snapper Mapper - A project to use the snapper topup API to expose travel information.

I also do freelancing from time-to-time. A range of current offerings of services can be found here: https://scriptedchicken.github.io/
