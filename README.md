- Hi there! I'm Angus, a geospatial developer based in Tauranga, New Zealand.
- I love learning about new technologies and APIs, especially those to do with automating GIS.
- I'm currently improving my skills in pyQGIS, C++, Arcpy, and the Esri suite. I also love working on projects in my spare time; anything from card-game making to exploring the Linux ecosystem.
- Interested in seeing more? You can find an interactive portfolio here: http://www.angushunt.co.nz/
